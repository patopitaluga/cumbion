Simple variables are valid identifiers that are not language keywords. A simple variable name must contain only letters, and cannot contain spaces. Cumbion does not allow numbers or underscores in variable names because you can't sing them. Simple variables are case-insensitive.

La Cumbia es 20
Laura es una diosa
